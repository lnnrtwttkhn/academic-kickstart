I am a PhD candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience and work with Nico Schuck in the Max Planck Research Group NeuroCode at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany. I am also a member of the International Max Planck Research School for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research. The main goal of my dissertation is to study hippocampal replay in humans using fMRI. My interests also include decision-making, fMRI methods, and tools that make science more open and reproducible.
